# angulardb
A web design and SEO marketing database front- and back-end application. Uses AngularJS with a RESTful PHP MySQL API.

## Installation

Development dependencies:

```bash
sudo npm install
```

Front-end dependencies:

```bash
bower install
```

Be sure to handle any permissions issues that arise.

As for _api/api.php_, it must be edited to point to an actual MySQL database with the corresponding tables. Future updates will include a more generalized API and the ability to modify the API settings more easily through JSON configuration files.
